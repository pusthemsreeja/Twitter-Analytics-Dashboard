## 🔎 Insights

**URL Clicks by Week & Day**
- **Tuesday dominates** link traffic; **Friday** is next.  
- Monday/Thursday are mid-tier; weekends weaker.  
**Action:** Schedule **CTA/link posts on Tuesdays**; use **Fridays** for follow-ups/recaps.

**Impressions by Week & Day**
- Mostly steady with **one major spike around day 10/11** → likely a **campaign/viral tweet**.  
**Action:** Annotate and replicate winning factors (topic, media type, timing).

**Top-5 Engagement-Rate Tweets**
- Several posts hit **~25–38% ER** → templates for future content.  
**Action:** Document their traits (format, hook, media, posting time).

**Click Type Breakdown (Pie)**
- **URL clicks ≈ 2,829** (largest)
- **Profile clicks ≈ 2,568**

**Action:** Double-down on **clear CTAs** and **profile prompts**; keep hashtags minimal but targeted.

**Media Engagement vs Media Views**

**Action:** Improve conversion: stronger first frame/thumbnail, tighter hook, explicit CTA/link.

**Tweets by Week(Volume)**
- Volume peaks mid-month (bars ~60).  
**Action:** Compare weeks using **Impressions per Tweet** & **CTR** to avoid “more tweets → more metrics” bias.

Anchor big posts on **Tuesdays**; recap on **Fridays**.  
Prioritize **links/CTAs**; keep hashtags focused.  
Investigate the **day-10/11 spike**; replicate what worked and boost media-to-engagement conversion.
